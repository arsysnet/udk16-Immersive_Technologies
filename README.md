Olofsson: Audiovisual Programming - Immersive Technologies

In this course we will explore the effects of repetitive and minimally changing patterns in computer audio and graphics. We will study how to overload our senses with stroboscopes, drone and trance music, perceptual illusions, beating sines, tunnel effects and mesmerizing fractal-like landscapes - all using hardware commonly available in clubs and theaters. The aim is to create immersive audiovisual compositions for experiencing altered states of mind and present these at the end of the semester. The software in use will be [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io). Bring your own laptop.
The course requires no background in computer programming and will be taught in English.
